# NamastePymc3: An MCMC Analysis of Single Transiting Exoplanets with Pymc3

NamastePymc3 is an update to the previous Namaste code](http://github.com/hposborn/Namaste) using the ["exoplanet" models of Dan Foreman-Mackey et al](http://github.com/dfm/exoplanet). 
This uses a PyMC3/Theano back-end, a differentiable Keplerian orbital model, and the Gaussian process modeling of [Celerite](http://github.com/dfm/celerite) to fit exoplanetary transits.

Here we simply provide a pre-written model build in exoplanet to model single transits, and plot/analyse the results.

See [Example.ipynb](https://github.com/hposborn/NamastePymc3/blob/master/Example.ipynb) for an example of how to use it.
